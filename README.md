# claude-code-agents
Agents for Claude Code

To "install", link to the `agents` subdir of your home `.claude` directory:

    git clone git@github.com:matsengrp/claude-code-agents.git
    cd claude-code-agents
    ln -s $PWD ~/.claude/agents

(this will only work if you haven't made your own agents already.)
